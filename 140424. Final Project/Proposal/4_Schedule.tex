\section{Expected Outcomes and Schedule}

\subsection{Expected Outcomes}
% In our project we plan on
% 
% we plan on developing an app that will address or automate tough problems in decentralizing the internet....  
% Framework, we plan on developing a framework to address the problems with changing ip addresses.....
The expected outcomes of our project can be divided into four stages. In stage 1, we plan to identify, install and deploy our framework with off-the-shelf technology (VPN server with public IPs and DNS) to meet our basic needs. 
Next, in stage two we plan to extend our framework beyond off-the-shelf technologies in order to ensure the framework is capable of executing all our needs in terms of analysis and system features.
Third, we will integrate use cases to our framework, meaning we will deploy applications that will allow us to test our system. Example applications we consider in deploying are wordpress or open source source social media.
In the last stage, we plan to test and analyze performance of the system in terms of failover, power and other device capability dependent issues. 

\subsection{Schedule}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Beginning March - Framework Setup: Get connectivity and reachability on phones (VPN server with public IPs and DNS)
 \item Early March - Framework Setup: Servers installation (Web and Email)
 \item Mid March - Midterm Presentation: We will have basic experimental framework installed so we can start working on novel issues (replication, failover, and power).
 \item Ending March - Data Replictaion: Basic replication scheme working
 \item Early April - Failover: Basic failover mechanism developed and implemented
 \item Mid April - Power: Experiment with performance and power
 \item April 22- Final Report: Integrate results into the final report
 \item April 22 - Final Presentation: Polish and integration into ``app`` 
\end{itemize}
