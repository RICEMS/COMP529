\begin{abstract}
We propose to build and investigate a novel decentralized internet architecture in which servers are replaced with point to point communication for personal communication and services. %whenever possible.
Previously, servers have been a necessary part of the Internet to act as intermediaries between people who didn't have pervasive connectivity.
With the wide-spread adoption of smart-phones and wireless data, this antiquated paradigm is becoming less and less necessary, since there is no technological reason that devices can't connect directly to one another.
Indeed, there are many potential advantages to decentralizing the Internet, including security, privacy, resilience, cost, and power.
However, this novel decentralized architecture also presents many challenges, such as redundancy, uptime, and failover.
In this course project we will build a first generation decentralized Internet framework and address some of these challenges, as well as explore the unique opportunities, presented by this architecture.
