\section{Introduction}
\label{Introduction}
In the early days of the Internet it was incredibly rare for normal users to have persistent, always-on connections.  
This limitation was addressed by servers, computers that were always on and always connected to the Internet,
which served as an intermediary for communication between users.  
This server-client paradigm shaped the architecture of the Internet, and still dominates web communication today. 

However, with the penetration of always-on broadband and data-enabled cell-phones, coupled with the emergence of IPv6, which includes mobile IP, there is no longer a technological limitation which requires servers.  
The computers in our pockets have over a 99\% uptime and connectivity~\cite{rahmati2007context}!  
Indeed, centralized servers have many drawbacks, ranging from privacy, security, and fault-tolerance, to even energy-efficiency and control over data. 
An example centralized system is shown in Figure~\ref{Fig.Centalize}.
By decentralizing the Internet we could make it much robust to failure, much more secure; furthermore we could do away with many energy-hungry server-farms, and reclaim control of personal data. 
An example decentralized system is shown in Figure~\ref{Fig.Decentalize}.

While the idea of using our phones as personal servers is rather straightforward, it still raises many technical barriers.  
How do we ensure reachability?  
What happens if the cell-phone loses connectivity?  
What if it is lost/broken/stolen?  We need to find novel methods to ensure redundancy for both uptime and data.  
To address these issues we propose building a small cluster consisting of your personal devices (home computer, laptop, even router) possibly combined with friendsâ€™ and family devices to guarantee reliability and connectivity.

In light of this, we propose to build a first generation decentralized architecture which supports typical personal communication and applications including:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Email
  \item Web Pages
  \item Social Networking
  \item Chat
	%\item Voice Calls (VoIP)
\end{itemize}
