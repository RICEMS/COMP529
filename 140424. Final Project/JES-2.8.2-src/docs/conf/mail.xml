            # GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE name type and 'service@hostname' format...
            # is RECOMMENDED'. However SUN's GSS SASL implementation requires that a
            # SASLServer is acquired from the SASL factory by calling a static method
            # where both protocol(serviceType) and server name are supplied. If one
            # checks out the openJDK6 source's com.sun.security.sasl.gsskerbGssKrb5Server

            # non GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE identities can not be used. A dual smtp/pop
            # serviceType is assumed by JES and if no smtp/hostname and pop/hostname principal
            # exists in the default kerberos realm authentication will fail. To conclude,
            # the following formats are acceptable:
            # 1. host.example.com: smtp and pop are assumed to be the service types.
            # 2. SMTPServiceName:POP3ServiceName/host.example.com: ....serviceName(e.g. ldap)
            # is used instead of smtp or pop. Possible combos for this case are:
            # ldap:pop/host.example.com, (use ldap as smtp, pop as pop)
            # :ldap/host.example.com, (use default as smtp, ldap as pop)
            # pop:/host.example.com, (use pop as smtp, default as pop)
