				<h3>The Grand Vision</h3>
				<p><a href=""><img src="images/decentralized.png" width="230" height="200" alt="Decentralized" class="float-right" /></a>
				In the early days of the Internet it was incredibly rare for normal users to have persistent, always-on connections.
				This limitation was addressed by servers, computers that were always on and always connected to the Internet, which served
				as an intermediary for communication between users. This server-client paradigm shaped the architecture of the Internet, and still dominates web communication today.
				</p>
				<p>
				However, with the penetration of always-on broadband and
				data-enabled cell-phones, coupled with the emergence of IPv6,
				which includes mobile IP, there is no longer a technologi-
				cal limitation which requires servers. The computers in our
				pockets have over a 99% uptime and connectivity! In-
				deed, centralized servers have many drawbacks, ranging from
				privacy, security, and fault-tolerance, to even energy-efficiency
				and control over data. An example centralized system is shown
				in Figure 1. By decentralizing the Internet we could make it
				much robust to failure, much more secure; furthermore we
				could do away with many energy-hungry server-farms, and
				reclaim control of personal data.
				</p>				
				<p>
				While the idea of using our phones as personal servers is
				rather straightforward, it still raises many technical barriers.
				How do we ensure reachability? What happens if the cell-
				phone loses connectivity? What if it is lost/broken/stolen? We
				need to find novel methods to ensure redundancy for both
				uptime and data. To address these issues we propose building
				a small cluster consisting of your personal devices (home
				computer, laptop, even router) possibly combined with friends
				and family devices to guarantee reliability and connectivity.
				</p>
				<p>
				In light of this, we propose to build a first generation
				decentralized architecture which supports typical personal
				communication and applications including:
				<ul>
				<li>Email</li>
				<li>Webpages</li>
				<li>Social Networking</li>
				</ul>
