##################### Recipient Policy #####################
# This file is used by the recipient policy mechanism
# to identify whether a recipient should be accepted/
# reject during a mail session. The policy is enforced when
# a message from a user of a locally administered domain is
# being received by the server. Both a global acceptance/
# rejection list and a per jes-domain list are offered.
# Per jes-domain entries supersede the global ones. That
# is, any domain listed in the jes-domain list will always
# take precedence over the opposite global entry during a
# session with a sender from the said domain. E.g. for a
# jes-domain named mydomain.com with entries in this file:
# allow=domainABC.com, block.mydomain.com=domainABC.com
# JES will always reject recipients at domainABC.com from
# any sender at the mydomain.com jes-domain and allow its
# use by all other jes-domains. If both block and allow
# entries exist, the block entries take precedence and the
# allow list is ignored. This applies to both global and
# per jes-domain entries. A valid explicit allow(block) entry
# instantly places an implicit  block(allow) setting for all
# other domains. E.g. for a policy
# allow.mydomain.com=domainABC.com JES will block all traffic
# from domain mydomain.com except messages intended for
# recipients at domainABC.com. A global block on domainABC.com
# will be ignored as well as any global allow entry (for the
# jes-domain in this example).
# Take note that in the case of a jes-domain entry the jes-domain
# itself is treated like any other recipient domain. Therefore
# if it is not defined in the list of allowed(blocked) domains
# any recipient belonging to the said jes-domain will be blocked
# (allowed).
# The entries in this file have the following format:
# allow=
# block=
# for global entries and
# allow.mydomain.com=
# block.mydomain.com=
# for a jes-domain called mydomain.com.
